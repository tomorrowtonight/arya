					Company may change, suspend or discontinue the Services (or User’s access thereto) at any time,
					including the availability of any feature, advertisement, publisher or Content, without notice or
					liability. Company reserves the right, at its discretion, to refuse to allow access to the Services
					to any User at any time. Company also reserves the right, at its discretion, to modify this
					Agreement at any time by posting a notice on the Site, or by sending User a notice via email or
					postal mail. Use of the Services by User following such notification constitutes User’s acceptance
					of the modified terms and conditions. User certifies to Company that if User is an individual (i.e.,

				<h2>Restrictions</h2>
				<p>User (whether a publisher, advertiser or otherwise) warrants, represents and agrees that it will not
					contribute, submit or make available through the Services, or use the Services in connection with,
					any Content that is infringing, libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, abusive, offensive or

					clicks on any advertisement, including but not limited to, through repeated manual clicks, the use
					of robots or other automated query tools and/or computer generated search requests, and/or the
					fraudulent use of other search engine optimization services and/or software. Company reserves the
					right to remove any Content from the Site at any time, or to terminate User’s right to use the
					Services or access the Site, for any reason (including, but not limited to, upon receipt of claims
					or allegations from third parties or authorities relating to such Content or if Company is concerned
					that User may have breached the terms of this paragraph), or for no reason at all, subject to the
					provisions of paragraph 13 (”Termination”). User is responsible for all of its activity in
					connection with the Services and accessing the Site. User may not post or transmit, or cause to be
					posted or transmitted, any communication or solicitation designed or intended to obtain password,
					account, or private information from any Company user. User shall not use any part of the Site or
					Services to violate the security of any computer network, crack passwords or security encryption
					codes, transfer or store material that is deemed threatening or obscene, or engage in any kind of
					illegal activity. User will not run Maillist, Listserv, any form of auto-responder, or “spam” on the
					Site or Services, or any processes that run or are activated while the User is not logged in.

					AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO USER.</p>
				<h2>FEES AND PAYMENT</h2>
				<p>Some of the Services require payment of fees. Company reserves the right to change its price list and
					to institute new charges at any time, upon prior notice to User, which may be sent by email or
					posted on the Site. If User is an advertiser, User shall pre-pay all applicable fees, as described
					on the Site, in connection with such Services selected by User. If User is a publisher, User shall
					receive a percentage of the Net Revenue of Advertisements associated with User’s use of the Services
					as solely determined by Company. “Net Revenue” shall mean revenues actually received by Arya-mg.com
					from the sale, use or other disposition of Advertisements displayed on Publisher’s Mobile Property
					less sales, use and excise taxes, less any agency commissions, carrier and/or partner fees, and less
					any allowances actually made or taken for returns, cash discounts or promotional allowances but
					excluding other revenues indirectly earned, if applicable, for consulting, planning and targeting,
					copywriting, site building, account management or technical modifications or technical innovations
					which may be charged by Arya-mg.com to third parties from time to time. The portion of Net Revenue
					received by User shall be determined on the first Monday of each calendar month, on which day those
					revenues accrued to User’s account thirty (30) or more days earlier shall become eligible to be
					paid. Payments to User shall be sent by Company only if User’s earned balance is greater than or
					equal to $500USD (Five Hunderd Dollars, US). If User’s earned balance is less than $500USD, no
					payment shall be sent until the following calendar month, on the first Monday of which Company shall
					make the aforesaid determination anew. In addition, if User is a publisher, User agrees that any
					payments that may become due to User (as described on the Site) are specifically conditioned upon
					Company’s receipt of full payment from the applicable advertiser. If Company does not receive the
					applicable payment in full from any such advertiser, Company shall have no liability or
					responsibility to User (and User hereby releases Company) with respect thereto. If User disputes any
					payment made in connection with the Services, User must notify Company in writing within thirty (30)
					days of any such payment. Failure to so notify Company shall result in the waiver by User of any
					claims related to such disputed payment. Payment shall be calculated solely based on records
					maintained by Company. No other measurements or statistics of any kind shall be accepted by Company
					or have any effect under this Agreement. Company shall not be liable for any payment based on (i)
					any fraudulent impressions generated by any person, robot, automated program or similar device or
					for fraudulent impressions similarly generated on any advertisements, as reasonably determined by
					Company; (ii) impressions commingled with a significant number of fraudulent impressions or
					fraudulent clicks described in (i) above; or (iii) any breach of this Agreement by User. To ensure
					proper payment, User is solely responsible for providing and maintaining accurate contact and
					payment information associated with User’s account and Company User ID. User agrees to pay all
					applicable taxes or charges imposed by any government entity in connection with User’s use of the
					Services.
