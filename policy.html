        </p>
        <p><h2>HOW WE USE PERSONAL DATA</h2>
            According to the GDPR, the Federal Data Protection Act and other laws that regulate data protection, we can
            only process your personal data with your legal consent.</p>
        <p><span>a) Processing for the fulfilment of contractual obligations (Article 6 paragraph 1 b) GDPR</span></p>
        <p>We primarily use and collect your personal data to run the information and multimedia services.</p>
        <p>However, some of your data are also collected for advertising purposes:
        </p>
        <p>if you participate in the information and multimedia services (which is funded by advertising) via the online
            form and grant consent for advertising at the same time, the subject matter of the information and
            multimedia contract concluded also includes the transfer of data for promotional purposes. In this case,
            your contractual consideration is that you grant consent for advertising which enables us and our sponsors
            to provide advertising in the areas mentioned (post, email and telephone advertising). For this reason, the
            data are stored in accordance with Article 6 1 b) GDPR and used by us for advertising purposes. The data are
            then also passed on to the sponsors to provide advertising in the areas mentioned. If you terminate the
            information and multimedia contract, we will then refrain from continuing to use these data for advertising
            purposes.
        </p>
        <p>If you conclude a value added services / information and multimedia contract without obligation on your part
            to grant consent for advertising, the above-mentioned use of the data for advertising purposes will not
            apply.</p>
        <p><span>b) Processing on the basis of your consent (Article 6 paragraph 1 a) GDPR</span></p>
        <p>We also process your data on the basis of consent for advertising if you grant us this consent when
            registering for the information and multimedia. In this case, we use the data ourselves for advertising
            purposes and forward it to our sponsors within the scope of the consent you granted.</p>
        <p><span>c) Processing to protect legitimate interests (Article 6 paragraph 1 1 f) GDPR</span></p>
        <p>If you answer questions after/during registering for the information and multimedia which do not refer to a
            specific product, we will store your answers with your personal data to ensure targeted advertising. In the
            case of answers which do refer to a specific product, we will forward your answer to the relevant
            company.</p>

        <p><h3>SHARING AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA</h3>
            In the following sub-points, we explain who we send your data to and when we send the data to what are known
            as third countries. Third countries are countries outside of the European Economic Area. We process your
            data internally in several departments. We primarily send data to external service providers as we do not
            provide some services ourselves or cannot sensibly provide them ourselves. We have external service
            providers that we use for all our data processing and external service providers who only receive data if
            you specifically choose for this data to be sent.
        </p>
        <p><span>a) Internal recipients and general external service providers</span> Internally, all departments which
            need the data for the above-mentioned purposes have access to your data.</p>
        <p>Data validation</p>
        <p>Newsletter sendings</p>
        <p>We also use external service providers to process the data for these purposes.</p>
        <p>Date-hosting</p>

        <p><span>b) Passing on to our sponsors or the providers of specific product offers
</span></p>
        <p>If you have declared your consent to receive advertising from our sponsors / third parties when registering
            for the information and multimedia services, we may pass your data on to these sponsors. However, the data
            will not be forwarded to all sponsors. Instead, we will select the companies to which we send the data.
            However, we will continue to pass the data on to our sponsors after consent for advertising has been revoked
            where this is necessary to provide evidence of consent that had been granted in the past.</p>
        <p>Your data will also be passed on to companies in whose products you have shown a specific interest after
            completion of the registration.</p>
        <p><h3>DATA RETENTION PERIOD</h3>
            The period for which your data will be stored depends on the legal principle of data processing:
        </p>
        <p>Data that we only receive to provide information and multimedia services will be deleted no later than three
            months after the service has been completed. Information and multimedia is deemed to have been completed
            when you have stopped your subscription by sending us relevant information via phone or e-mail.</p>
        <p>Data that we have received for promotional purposes will be deleted ten years after the reason for the data
            being stored no longer applies. If you grant us consent for advertising, we will delete your data ten years
            after the revocation or final use of your data. Long storage of this type is necessary as we still have to
            provide evidence that the promotional use by us or our partners was legally admissible even after the
            consent has been revoked. If the consent is revoked before the data have been used for advertising purposes,
            the data will be deleted within a month of consent being revoked.</p>
        <p><h3>GDPR</h3>
            The General Data Protection Regulation guarantees you certain rights that you can assert over us. You have
            the right:

                specific circumstances of the data processing (<span>Article 15 GDPR: right of access by the data subject)</span>
            </li>
            <li>to request that we correct incorrect personal data concerning you immediately. Taking into account the
                purpose of the processing you also have the right to request the completion of incomplete personal data,
                including by means of a supplementary declaration (Article 16 GDPR: right to rectification)
            </li>
            <li>to request that we correct incorrect personal data concerning you immediately. Taking into account the
                purpose of the processing you also have the right to request the completion of incomplete personal data,
                including by means of a supplementary declaration <span>(Article 16 GDPR: right to rectification)</span>
            </li>
            <li>to request that we delete personal data concerning you immediately <span>(Article 17 GDPR: right of deletion)</span>
            </li>
            <li>to request that we restrict processing
                <span>(Article 18 GDPR: right to restriction of processing)</span></li>
            <li>in the event of processing based on consent or for performance of a contract, to receive the personal
                data concerning you that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable
                format and to transmit these data to another responsible without hindrance from us or to transmit these
                data directly to another responsible person where this is technically feasible <span>(Article 20 GDPR: right to data portability)</span>
            </li>
            <li>to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time, to the processing of personal
                data that is necessary for the performance of a task in the public interest or the exercise of official
                authority <span>(Article 21 GDPR: right to object)</span>
            </li>
            <li>to lodge a complaint at any time with a supervisory authority, in particular in the member state of
                their habitual residence, their workplace or the place of the alleged infringement if you are of the
                opinion that the processing of the personal data concerning you infringes applicable law <span>(Article 77 GDPR in combination with Section 19 of the Federal Data Protection Act: right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority).</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you have granted us consent, you ultimately have the right to revoke your consent at any time. In this
            case, all data processing carried out by us up to the point at which you revoked your consent remains legal.
            Once you have revoked your consent we will no longer use the data you provided for advertising purposes. We
            will also not pass your data on to third parties for advertising purposes.</p>
        <p><h3>Security</h3>
            We use technical and organisational security measures to ensure that your personal data are protected
            against loss, incorrect modifications and unauthorised access by third parties. In any case, from our side
            it is only authorised persons who have access to your personal data, and they only have this to the extent
            required for the above-mentioned purposes. The security measures are constantly being adapted to the
            improvements in technical possibilities.
        </p>

        <p><span>b) Facebook Pixel</span>
            We use Facebook Pixel by Facebook Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Square, Dublin 2, Ireland, on our websites.
            It offers several functions, and we use the Custom Audiences function. This means that if you have a
            Facebook user account our advertisement will be displayed on Facebook in a targeted manner. In order to do
            this, Facebook Pixel creates a direct connection between our website and the Facebook servers. Your usage
            data are sent to Facebook for analysis and marketing purposes. If you have a Facebook account, these data
            can be attributed to you. Tracking means that under certain circumstances your Facebook activity can be
            tracked by several websites. We have no influence over any processing of personal data as this is the sole
            responsibility of Facebook. You can find more information on the collection and use of data by Facebook in
            the Facebook data protection notice on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/policy">https://www.facebook.com/policy</a>

            settings in your Facebook user account on:
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads">https://www.facebook.com/ads</a>
        <p><span>c) Google Analytics</span>
            This website uses the web analysis service Google Analytics and the service Google Remarketing, both
            provided by Google Inc. (“Google”). Through the Google Remarketing service, users who have already visited
            our websites and online services and shown an interest in what we offer will be appealed to again through
            targeted advertising on Google Partner Network websites. The advertising is overlaid using cookies. The text
            files can be used to analyse user behaviour when visiting the website and then make targeted product
            recommendations and provide advertisements based on interest. Google Analytics also uses cookies. The
            information generated by the cookie about your use of this site (including your IP address) is usually
            transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. Of course we use Google Analytics with the
            function anonymizeIP, so your IP address is absolutely anonymised through masking.

        </p>
        <p>Google will use the information to evaluate your use of the website in order to generate reports on the
            website activity for the website owner in order to provide additional services associated with the use of
            the website and the use of the internet. Google may also transfer this information to third parties if
            required to do so by law or where third parties process this data on behalf of Google. Third party
            providers, including Google, use the information stored in the cookies as part of the Google Remarketing
            service to display advertisements on other websites on the basis of a user’s previous visits to that
            website. Google will not link your IP address to other data held by Google under any circumstances even if
            it is masked.</p>
        <p>You can prevent the installation of the cookies by changing the relevant settings on your browser software or
            by installing a browser add-on (can be accessed via <a href="https://tools.google.com">https://tools.google.com</a>);
            we wish to note, however, that if you do this you may not be able to use all of the functions of this
            website to the full extent. By using this website, you agree to the processing of the information collected
            about you by Google in the manner described and for the aforementioned purpose.</p>
